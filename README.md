# Capture Card Relay
While this is meant for viewing and listening to a capture cards output, it is, essentially, a webcam viewer and a microphone relay.
left arrow cycles video streams(cameras), right arrow cycles microphones, up and down arrow raises/lowers volume.

Not compatible with Windows, although all it should need is the settings paths changed, haven't tested outside NixOS.
